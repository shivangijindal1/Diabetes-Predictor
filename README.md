# Diabetes-Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on health parameters using ANN, RNN, and LSTM models. The project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to healthcare data to support early diagnosis and better decision-making.

🚀 Features

Predicts probability of Diabetes / No Diabetes

Implements three deep learning models:

✔️ Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

✔️ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

✔️ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

End-to-end pipeline:

Data cleaning

Feature scaling

Model training

Evaluation
